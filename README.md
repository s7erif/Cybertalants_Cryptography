# 🔐 Cybertalents Cryptography Write-ups  
### By Sherif Osman

This repository contains my solutions and write-ups for **Cryptography challenges** from the **CyberTalents platform**.  
These challenges helped me strengthen my understanding of encryption, encoding, hashing, and classical cryptographic attacks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Through these challenges, I practiced and demonstrated skills in:

- Classical cipher analysis  
- Hash cracking and hash identification  
- RSA fundamentals and attacks  
- Encoding and decoding techniques  
- Steganography and hidden data extraction  
- Cryptographic misconfigurations and weaknesses  

This repository documents my learning journey in **Applied Cryptography for CTFs and Security Research**.
